Question 2
Arithmetic Operators
let x = 200;
let y = 10;

console.log(x + y);
console.log(x / y);

Assignment Operators
let x = 200;
x = x * 5

Comparison Operators
let x >= 5;

console.log( x > 6); // returns false
console.log( x < 4 ); // returns true

Logical Operators
Given that x = 15 and y = 5;

console.log( x > 10 && y < 6); returns true
console.log( x > 20 && y > 10); returns false
